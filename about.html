      <h2 class="mb-3">A Celebration of Charleston Food Culture</h2>
      <p>
        Shrimp & grits has deep roots in South Carolina history, originating as a simple fisherman’s
        breakfast and evolving into a signature dish found on menus throughout Charleston.
        This event was created to celebrate that evolution — highlighting both heritage and innovation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond the food, the event brings together chefs, locals, visitors, and sponsors who share
        a passion for Charleston’s culinary scene and community spirit.
